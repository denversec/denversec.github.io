  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
  <p>DenverSec is just one of the many local CitySec meet-ups around the world. CitySec was spawned out of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/" target="_blank">/r/NetSec</a> as a way to bring together local communities with a shared interest in information security.</p>
  <p>The Denver meet-up is designed specifically to be a social gathering. There are no presentations or slide decks and sales pitches are discouraged. All are welcome -- even if you're not working in the industry!</p>

  <h2 id="meetup">Monthly Meet-Up</h2>
	<p>The dates, locations, and times can sometimes vary but we <i>usually</i> meet on the third Wednesday of each month at a downtown location, starting at 7:00 PM. Be sure to follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.social.twitter }}" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a rel="me" href="https://{{ site.social.mastodon_instance }}/@{{ site.social.mastodon }}" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> to keep up with the upcoming meet-ups and related announcements.</p>
