  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
  <p>DenverSec is just one of the many local CitySec meet-ups around the world. CitySec was spawned out of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/" target="_blank">/r/NetSec</a> as a way to bring together local communities with a shared interest in information security.</p>
  <p>The Denver meet-up is designed specifically to be a social gathering. There are no presentations or slide decks and sales pitches are discouraged. All are welcome -- even if you're not working in the industry!</p>

  <h2 id="meetup">Meet-Up</h2>
	<p>We usually meet on the third Wednesday of each month at a downtown location. The dates and locations can sometimes vary, but they always start at 7:00 PM. Be sure to follow our Twitter account, @<a href="https://twitter.com/DenverSec" target="_blank">DenverSec</a>, to keep up with the upcoming meet-ups and related announcements.</p>
