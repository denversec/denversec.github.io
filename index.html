  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Denver CitySec is just one of the many local CitySec meetups around the world. CitySec was spawned out of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/" target="_blank">/r/NetSec</a> as a way to bring together local communities with a shared interest in information security.</p>
  <p>The Denver meetup is designed specifically to be a social gathering. There are no presentations or slide decks and sales pitches are discouraged.</p>

  <h2>Meetups</h2>
	<p>We meet on the third Wednesday of each month at a downtown location. The locations can vary, but they always start at 7:00 PM. Be sure to follow our Twitter account, @<a href="https://twitter.com/DenverSec" target="_blank">DenverSec</a>, to keep up with upcoming meetups and other related announcements.</p>
